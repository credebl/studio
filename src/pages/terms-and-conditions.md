# TERMS AND CONDITIONS 

## 1. Validity of the General Terms and Conditions

1.1 The usage of the "ADEYA" Self-sovereign Identity Edge Wallet (the "ADEYA App") is subject to these general terms and conditions (the "GTC"). The ADEYA App offers constant access to and viewing of the GTC.

1.2 The terms of these GTC apply to the use of the ADEYA App and associated services as well as the provision of all services and advantages linked to the ADEYA App.

1.3 Blockster Labs Pvt Ltd Company provides users with access to self-sovereign identification networks through the ADEYA App in accordance with the terms of these GTC.

1.4 Other general terms and conditions, such as the user's, do not apply, despite the user's wants. Only if Blockster Labs Pvt Ltd Company expressly agrees to the user's general terms and conditions does the user presume their validity.

1.5 The legality of the remaining sections of these GTC shall not be impacted if any provision is or becomes illegal by influx of law or due to passage of time. The user and Blockster Labs Pvt Ltd Company agree to discuss the grounds for the invalidity of the provision to come up with a replacement provision that closely resembles its goals.

1.6 In the case of contractual discrepancy or variations, the same rule (Section 1.5) applies.

## 2. The ADEYA App's Purpose and Object of Performance

2.1 The ADEYA App is a state-of-the-art SSI-based mobile wallet application designed to securely store user credentials using cryptography. It allows users to safeguard their verifiable credentials and embrace the convenience of an identity wallet on their smartphones without compromising privacy. Blockster Labs Pvt Ltd Company develops the ADEYA App.

2.2 The ADEYA App is intended for the digital identification and authentication of natural persons. Users can obtain and store identity information about themselves from other participants and share it if required. The identity information may include legitimation data, creditworthiness data, payment transaction data, registration data, and other text-based information.

2.3 The ADEYA App connects to self-sovereign identity networks, enabling peer-to-peer connections with other participants. Users can exchange encrypted messages and receive other participants' identity information ("verifiable credentials"). They can also respond to identity requests from participants by sharing the relevant stored identity information. The ADEYA App is also connected to a digital mailbox service ("Mediation Agent") operated by Blockster Labs Pvt Ltd Company, ensuring secure message delivery.


## 3. The ADEYA App's Application and functionality

3.1 Application and Launch:
When the user starts the "ADEYA" App on their mobile phone, they are prompted to secure access to the app by entering a six-digit PIN code.

3.2 Tab Menu:
The "ADEYA" app's primary features are available through the tab navigation at the bottom of the app. There are two tabs on the tab menu: "Credentials" and "Home." The "Home" tab is the one that initially appears when the programme is opened. Identity information that is saved in the app is shown as separate card icons under the "Credentials" page. A card symbol can be touched to display extensive information about the issuer and the identifying attributes that have been recorded under "Info." Information regarding the use of the identification traits, including specifics of shared information, is displayed in the "Activities" section. The first card in the "Credentials" page that the user sees after receiving new identification information gives them the choice to accept or reject it.

3.3 Scan Button: 
The Scan button, which can be found in the bottom right of the app, gives users access to a QR Code scanner. With the use of this scanner, users may see and accept QR Code-based connection requests from other users. For this feature to work, the app needs access to the phone's camera.

3.4. App Settings:
The "ADEYA" App has a number of customization choices that are available from the toolbar by selecting the gear icon. The configuration options include:

- Language: Users have the option of changing the app's language.
- Utilise Biometrics: To increase security on their mobile phone, users can enable biometric authentication, such as fingerprint or face recognition.

3.5. Functionality:
- Establish Connections: Users can connect with one another by exchanging QR codes with other users. Users can learn more about the contact request's sender by scanning the QR code. Requests for contact might be approved or denied. A peer-to-peer connection is made after accepting a contact request. Under the "Contacts" icon in the menu, any connections that have already been made with other participants are shown. When a specific connection is chosen, all identification data transmitted to or received from that participant is shown.

- Sharing identification Information: Through already established peer-to-peer connections, participants can make identification queries to the user. The notification icon shows all identity requests. Existing identification attributes that are saved in the app are used to pre-fill the desired attributes. If suitable alternatives are available, users have the opportunity to manually edit this information. The "ADEYA" App's only job is to make it easier for participants to exchange information. An identification request can be refused if a user decides not to reply to it, in which case the asking participant won't receive any information. The submitted information is accessible either under the relevant card in the "Credentials" page when identification inquiries are successfully complied with.
- Support for numerous Hyperledger Indy networks: The "ADEYA" software now supports the mainnet of Sovrin, the BCovrin Ledger, as well as the Indicio network.

You accept and agree to the functionality as mentioned above, as well as any other terms and conditions that the app developer may have stated, by using the "ADEYA" App.
