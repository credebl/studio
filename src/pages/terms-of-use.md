## 2. The CREDEBL Platform’s & ADEYA App's Purpose and Object of Performance

2.1 The CREDEBL Platform (Verifiable Credential & Decentralised Identity management platform) and ADEYA App (Self-sovereign Identity Edge Wallet Application) are designed to securely store user credentials using cryptography. It allows users to safeguard their verifiable credentials and embrace the convenience of an identity wallet on their smartphones without compromising privacy. AYANWORKS develops the CREDEBL Platform and ADEYA App.

2.2 The CREDEBL Platform and ADEYA App are intended for the digital identification and authentication of natural persons. Users can obtain and store identity information about themselves from other participants and share it if required. The identity information may include legitimation data, creditworthiness data, payment transaction data, registration data, and other text-based information.

2.3 The CREDEBL Platform and ADEYA App connect to self-sovereign identity networks, enabling peer-to-peer connections with other participants.

The CREDEBL Platform is also connected to a digital mailbox service (SendGrid), ensuring secure message delivery.
