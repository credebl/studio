## 2. The CREDEBL Platform’s & ADEYA App's Purpose and Object of Performance

2.1 The CREDEBL Platform (Verifiable Credential & Decentralised Identity management platform) and ADEYA App (Self-sovereign Identity Edge Wallet Application) are designed to securely store user credentials using cryptography. It allows users to safeguard their verifiable credentials and embrace the convenience of an identity wallet on their smartphones without compromising privacy. Blockster develops the CREDEBL Platform and ADEYA App.

2.2 The CREDEBL Platform and ADEYA App are intended for the digital identification and authentication of natural persons. Users can obtain and store identity information about themselves from other participants and share it if required.
